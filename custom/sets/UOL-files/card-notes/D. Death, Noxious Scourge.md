During the course of a competition a player may fail to submit. The organizer may sometimes create a substitute card, with the initials "DNS" in the card name. (DNS is short for Did Not Submit)

Frenzy 1 is a mechanic from Future Sight. "Whenever this creature attacks and isn't blocked, it gets +1/+0 until end of turn."
